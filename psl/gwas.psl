// This is a method of solving the problem of clonal population structure,
// the single biggest challenge in microbial gwas.
// If two samples are similar, they are likely related, via either ancestry,
// HGT, or both. Let us denote `population` as the cluster of similar samples
// that are tightly related in this way. If many members of a population contain
// a kmer that connotes resistance, they also contain many kmers that do not
// connote resistance. However, since these kmers occur in samples that are
// resistant, they have a high probability of being false positives.
// It follows that the strongest indicator that a kmer connotes resistance is
// if it is present in two resistant samples that are weakly related. Thus:
// If two samples are not similar, and both are resistant, and both contain a
// certain kmer, that kmer likely connotes resistance.
